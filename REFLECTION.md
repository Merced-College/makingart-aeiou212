1. Which option did you choose (A, B, or C)?

    My group and I choose option A (Fixed Color Palette Using C-Style Arrays).

2. Where in your code did you use an array or a vector, and what does it store?

    My code used an array and arrays used the RBG colors with eachc index representing one color.

3. How did changing the color logic change the look of your fractal art?

    The fractal art is the same but the colors are drastically different and there is much of them.

4. (Optional) What was tricky about mapping iter to a palette index?

    Iter goes down to 0, I used % PALETTE_SIZE to turn it into a number from 0 to 5 so I could pick a color from the palette.
